## Technologies Used

The app is currently built with Javascript, React and Redux.
Other pieces of technologies include:

* [React-Promise-Middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware/blob/master/docs/introduction.md)(A middleware that will resolve a promise into one of the three results: FULFILLED, REJECTED or PENDING)

* [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)(A middleware orchestrates an asynchronous control flow with thunk action creators dispatching each other and returning Promises to wait for each other’s completion)
